      wasd to move. Arrow keys to rotate the camera. Press spacebar to pause. Use the slider bars on the right to 
      set the parameters for each particle system. Particle systems:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Planets of equal mass interact gravitational while bouncing elastically off a cylindrical constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Rope made from springs held together by a max separation constraint. windAmount controls wind speed, randAmount controls random variation in wind. Easy to break
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Fountain that constantly emits burning fire particles.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Spring mass system. To see instability of Euler solver, set K_spring = 10, K_damp = 0, dragConst and turbulence = 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Tornado. Circulation effects rotation rate of tornado. Cohesion reduces the diameter of the tornado. Updraft effects the speed at which particles are moved upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Rain. Water particles constantly fall from the ceiling onto a sphere constraint with K_resti = 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Boids. First gravConst is cohesion, which draws the boids closer together. Second gravConst is separation, which causes them to avoid neighbors.
      AlignConst determines the rate at which boids will align their heading with their neighbors. fov limits the view of boids to within default 60 degrees
      of their current heading. fov is only used for alignment
